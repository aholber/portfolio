        <p class="pintro">Hi, my name is Andrea and I am currently a Junior at the University of Michigan in the School of Information, studying Data and Information Analytics. I have always had a passion for art, specifically drawing people. My love of art grew in high school when I began taking more serious art classes. Soon after, I found myself spending any free period in the art room, drawing, painting, carving, melding metals. Any activity in which I could create something with beauty or meaning filled my time.</p>
      
        <p class="pintro">My favorite mediums to use are pencil and acryllic paint. I dabble in making jewelry and am currently learning graphic design with Photoshop and Abobe Illustrator. My interest in math and analytics outweighed my artistic abilities when choosing my career path. However, majoring in Information Sciences allows me to blend my creative half with my problem solving half by including classes like web design, graphic design, and many more. 
          <br> Hope you enjoy my art!
        </p>
