      <p id = "about1">Hi, my name is Andrea and I am currently a Junior at the University of Michigan in the School of Information, studying Data and Information Analytics. I have always had a passion for art, specifically drawing people. My love of art grew in high school when I began taking more serious art classes. Soon after, I found myself spending any free period in the art room, drawing, painting, carving, melding metals. Any activity in which I could create something with beauty or meaning filled my time.</p>
      <div></div>
      <p id = "about2">My interest in math and analytics outweighed my artistic abilities when choosing my career path. However, the classes I am currently taking, including web design and graphic design, allow me to blend my creative half with my problem-solving half. </p>
